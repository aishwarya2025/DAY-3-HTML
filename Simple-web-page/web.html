      Let us discuss about covid.</b></h>
      <p>
      COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in late 2019 and quickly became a global pandemic. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets and has caused widespread illness, hospitalizations, and deaths worldwide. Governments implemented measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, and mask mandates to control the spread. Vaccination campaigns have played a crucial role in reducing severe cases and fatalities. The pandemic also had significant social and economic impacts, disrupting education, businesses, and healthcare systems. While the world has gradually adapted to living with the virus, continued vigilance, vaccination efforts, and public health measures remain essential to managing future outbreaks.
